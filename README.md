# 🎄 Advent of Code Solutions 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** repository! This is where I document my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges, organized using Git branches for each puzzle part.

## 📅 About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is an annual series of programming puzzles. From December 1st to December 25th, a new two-part puzzle is released each day. It’s a fun way to:
- Sharpen programming skills.
- Explore new problem-solving techniques.
- Get into the holiday spirit! 🎅

Check it out on the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com).

## 🛠️ Repository Organization
Each day's puzzle is split into branches:
- **`Day-X-Part-Y`**: Solutions for individual parts of each day.
- **`main`**: May include general resources or a summary of progress.

Example branch names:
- `Day-1-Part-1`
- `Day-1-Part-2`
- `Day-2-Part-1`

To switch to a branch:
```bash
git checkout Day-X-Part-Y
